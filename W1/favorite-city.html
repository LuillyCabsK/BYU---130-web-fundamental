    <h1>Mi favorite city</h1>
    <p><b>My favorite city is Popayán.</b>
        
    First of all because its the place where I was born, and lived most of the time in my life.
    
    Also I like a lot because it is a small place that allows you to have many chances of being recognized and achieve success, unlike big cities where you are just another one of the crowd.

    I would definitely recommend living in small towns, but always keep the thought of getting ahead and succeeding in life. </p>
